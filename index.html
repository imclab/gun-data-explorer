                <h1>Gun Campaign Contributions by State</h1>
<p>
The graphic below gives state-by-state breakdowns for donations that groups on both sides of the gun debate gave to candidates for state offices (such as governor and state legislature) as well as to candidates for the presidency and U.S. Congress, as well as contributions to political parties and PACs. Pro-gun groups, dominated by the National Rifle Association, out-spend gun control groups in every state. Not included in this chart, but another key component in the influence picture: independent expenditures made by groups in support or opposition to candidates for office. You can find those -- and sort by group or state -- on Sunlight's <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/">Follow the Unlimited Money</a>.

To use this graphic: Clicking on a state will get you a fly-out box on the right that provides a detailed breakdown and precise amounts of contributions. Clicking on any one of the bars in that box will take you to source data at <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com">Influence Explorer</a>. There you can download tables that will allow you to see who got money from whom. Influence Explorer gathers <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission (FEC)</a> data categorized by the <a href="http://opensecrets.org">Center for Responsive Politics</a> by industry (For more on the Center's methodology, see this <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/07/improved-ideological-coding.html">explanation</a>.) It also collects state-level data from the <a href="http://followthemoney.org/">National Institute for Money in State Politics</a>, which gathers information from all 50 states.
